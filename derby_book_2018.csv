1,20,50-1,Firenze Fire ,(60-1), Another one that I can't see getting the Derby distance; looks like he's going backwards.,109,37,2,70,0.34,0.02,0.64
2,19,30-1,Free Drop Billy,(40-1)," Will make one run, but won't even be nearly enough to make a challenge for the race.",192,67,5,120,0.35,0.03,0.63
3,18,30-1,Promises Fulfilled ,(50-1)," Is likely to be on the lead at the start of the race, but will stop before getting to the stretch.",139,35,4,100,0.25,0.03,0.72
4,14,30-1,Flameaway  ,(40-1)," Trainer Mark Casse says he's taken several steps forward since a second place in the Blue Grass, but it won't be enough to contend.",154,39,5,110,0.25,0.03,0.71
5,7,8-1,Audible  ,(10-1), He's not going to get the same perfect setup he had in the Florida Derby.,1655,942,46,667,0.57,0.03,0.40
6,8,12-1,Good Magic ,(7-1)," He has really looked awesome training at Churchill Downs the last week, but I wish he had gone up against a better field in the Blue Grass Stakes.",525,298,9,218,0.57,0.02,0.42
7,2,3-1,Justify  ,(2-1), Might just be a total freak; could get bet down quite a bit by the public.,3022,1301,101,1620,0.43,0.03,0.54
8,15,50-1,Lone Sailor ,(40-1), Another that is likely to be coming in the end; but just not good enough.,187,57,4,126,0.30,0.02,0.67
9,3,20-1,Hofburg  ,(30-1), So out of character for Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott  a Derby starter with only three races in his life. Has looked great on the track.,432,154,16,262,0.36,0.04,0.61
10,5,30-1,My Boy Jack,(16-1), I think he will pass a whole lot of tired horses down the stretch. He's a great closer.,391,113,5,273,0.29,0.01,0.70
11,4,8-1,Bolt d'oro ,(5-1), Won't shock me if he wins the race. He would have likely won any of the other final Derby preps.,470,97,10,363,0.21,0.02,0.77
12,13,30-1,Enticed  ,(18-1), He's just not a horse I think will get the mile-and-a-quarter distance in the Derby.,198,52,3,143,0.26,0.02,0.72
13,12,50-1,Bravazo  ,(50-1)," D. Wayne Lukas has won four Kentucky Derby races, but it would have to be his best training job ever. He's likely to be on the lead and then tire.",122,26,3,93,0.21,0.02,0.76
14,1,5-1,Mendelssohn  ,(9-2)," Still have him on top, but still want to see him once he travels to the U.S.",1393,280,93,1020,0.20,0.07,0.73

16,9,6-1,Magnum Moon ,(4-1)," He's 4-for-4 and won the Arkansas Derby, but looked so green down the stretch. It won't be an easy trip, which will hurt him.",553,155,42,356,0.28,0.08,0.64
17,10,30-1,Solomini  ,(20-1)," The forgotten horse in the Bob Baffert barn was second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but I don't see him hitting the board.",405,88,17,300,0.22,0.04,0.74
18,6,12-1,Vino Rosso ,(12-1), The fact that jockey John Velazquez picked this entry out of the Todd Pletcher barn makes him a live horse.,295,51,7,237,0.17,0.02,0.80
19,11,30-1,Noble Indy ,(24-1), Todd Pletcher put on blinkers in the Louisiana Derby  and he won. But this is a much tougher spot.,310,48,6,256,0.15,0.02,0.83
20,17,50-1,Combatant  ,(40-1)," He hasn't been racing against the toughest fields, but still hasn't won in a while. Won't again here.",232,13,3,216,0.06,0.01,0.93
